## Key Competitors in the AI Race and their Pricing Models

 > This is an opiniated topic based on my experience working on a daily-basis mostly with ChatGpt, and Gemini

For me, ChatGpt (OpenAI) is the most reliable one, but it's good compare answers and do some brainstorming with any other AI model of your choice, I use Gemini mostly for that reason.

Gemini is the best when it comes to searching and writing capabilities *(again, my opinion)*

DeepSeek is new, but it's really impressive, due its accurrecy (I couldn't notice a difference compared with ChatGPT). Also, their approach is quite different from the other existing models, details [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv8frWeKoeo)

### ChatGPT Plus vs DeepSeek Pricings

> üí∞ *A-chat is about 9 times cheaper than B, and A-reasoner is about 4.5 times cheaper than B. [details](price-comparison-estimative.png)*

**DeepSeek Chat**: A conversational AI model designed for natural, engaging, and context-aware interactions, ideal for chatbots and virtual assistants.

**DeepSeek Reasoner**: A reasoning-focused model optimized for logical problem-solving, step-by-step analysis, and structured tasks like math and data queries.

## ChatGPT Pro Pricing

üíØ **Unlimited* access to o1, o1-mini, GPT-4o**
> The exemptions seems fair to me.

From their site: "Access to o1 pro mode, which uses more compute for the best answers to the hardest questions"

‚ÅâÔ∏è I couldn't figure out concrete answers about usage limitation for **o1 pro** *(which uses more compute power)* and other models that might be available in the future (e.g., o3)
